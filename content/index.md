# About this site

I find the concept of personal knowledge management intriguing; the idea of creating a repository of personal learning is one I'm keen to explore. And lots of other people seem to think so too; the "[digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/)" has snowballed in popularity over the last couple of years. This is the starting point for mine--it's pretty sparse right now, but will (ü§ûüèª) grow over time... that's the idea, anyway.

To help me grow my garden, I'm building a little piece of software that I'm calling [_Magritte_](/magritte/index.html). It is going to be fairly opinionated and built to suit my preferences and the workflow that I want to support, with a strong lean towards keeping things as simple as I can make them (partly for ease of maintenance, partly because I'm not a "real" developer).

For me, both the garden itself and the process of building Magritte are exercises in thinking and learning in public, or as Andy Matuschak refers to it, "[working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)". If you care to follow along, all the code is available on [Github](https://github.com/campegg/garden).
